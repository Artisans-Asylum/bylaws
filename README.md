# Artisan's Asylum open Bylaws

These are the [bylaws](BYLAWS.md) of the [Artisans Asylum](https://www.artisansasylum.com/).

## Open for Comment

These bylaws are open for comments. To suggest an issue with the bylaws, please select the lines in gitub and select "open issue". Or create a more general issue.

## Open for Revision

To suggest a change to the bylaws, please fork this repo, make a change, and open a pull request. 

Change requests can also be commented on and voted on within the PR. Changes requests that have significant approval will be brought before the board by one of our core [maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/Artisans-Asylum/teams/maintainer).

## Note on currency

The latest version of the bylaws as approved by the board will always reside on the 'mainline' branch. Other branches (including work in progress to improve the bylaws) may exist, but cannot be merged unless they are approved. Please help ensure this invariant is maintained. As new versions become available and are approved, we will tag them with the date of approval.
